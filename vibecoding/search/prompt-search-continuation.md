Now I'd like to build a second webapp using the same dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/homericlanguage/refs/heads/main/scansion-expanded.cex but instead of looking up passages by reference, I want to let the user search the contents and optionally define metrical constraints on the search. Users should be allowed to search on a simplified Greek text that is the smae as the text displayed in the text view of the first app but with accents and breathings removed. 

The app should present a paged display of results listing each passage and displaying the contents as displayed in the *syllables* display of the first app.

---

Fabulous! Now I'd like to offer the user the option of adding a metrical constraint by entering a *foot-syllable* identifier in the form `FOOT.SYLLABLE`.  Recall that this is encoded in the final two period-separated pieces of the `Syllable` column's passage value. Searching should only match strings beginning at the specified syllable-foot point. **Example**:  if these lines were part of the records for passage `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1`, a search for `αειδε` would match.  But if the user addes the metrical constraint `2.1`, then `αειδε` would not match because we would only begin considering text from the `Token` with identifier `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.2.1`.

```

I think I made a mistake in describing the example above. If we search for `θεα` with no metrical constraint, we should match. If we search for `θεα` with metrical constraint `2.3`, we should match because we begin considering text from `Syllable` with ID `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.2.3`. (I mistakenly said `Token` above: I'm sorry!) Thus we find the two `Syllables` with records `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1|urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.2.3|θε|short|urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.3|1` and `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1|urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.3.1|ὰ|long|urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.3|1` yield a matching string for `θεα`. But if we search for `θεα` with metrical constraint `3.1`, we would *not* match, since we would only begin considering text from the `Syllable` with identifer `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.hmtx:1.1.3.1`. Could you try that again?

Still failing to get any results when metrical constraints apply. Is the difficulty aligning the search term with the syllabified text? Let's test that by applying yellow highlight to the text of syllables that match the search term. (That's a good UI in any case!) So in the example data above, if you searched for `θεα`, you should highlight the syllables appearing in the syllables text display as `θε-ὰ`.

---
Please apply the highlighting also when there is no metrical constraint.

---
Perfect! Now lets add a further feature that will be useful to users and help us debug. Make each syllable clickable; in a column to the right of the text display, show the Foot-Syllable identifier for the clicked syllable.

---

This is great! Now I'd like to extend this by giving the user a menu to choose one of the following search modes when defining metrical constrait: 1) "Starts from" -- that's the current behavior 2) "Ends with" : in this mode, we want to find lines where the search string *ends* at the given foot-syllable identifier 3) "Follows" -- this should match strings that either start at exactly the given position (current behavior, same as "Starts from"), *or* any later position in the line, 4) "Precedes" -- this should match strings that either end at exactly the given position (same as "Ends with") *or* ends at any position before the given foot-syllable identifier. Could you implement this?

--

This is excellent. It only works with query strings that match complete syllables. For example, if I search for either `λευκωλεν` or `λευκωλενος`, I will match passages that include this sequence in their syllable display: `λευκ-ώλ-εν-ος`, because both `λευκωλεν` and `λευκωλενος` complete a sequence of syllables. But if I search for passages that match `λευκωλενο`, I will find 0 matches. Can you change this?

---

Great! The functionality is perfect! Now let's tweak the display without changing the functionality. First, let's give the user an option to "Include metrical constraint". If the user does *not* check it, keep the display of the "Search mode" menu and the "Foot.syllable" constraint hidden; make them visible if hte user does check that option.

---

That’s generating a series of errors. Let’s revert to the previous version.

---

Good. Now please change the label "Foot.Syllable Constraint" to "Foot-syllable", and move the label and input box next to the "Search  mode:" menu (on the same line horizontally).

---

OK but now the search mode menu and input for foot-syllable are repeated. Please fix this.

---

Display looks good but now the searches don't work if metrical constraints are included. Did you lose track of which HTML elements to use?
