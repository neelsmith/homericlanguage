## Source for scansion

Scansion of the *Iliad* is based on the openly available data provided here:

> I have not yet found information on the site to credit the author properly.


The 24 CSV files are organized by book.  Each has a header line with these column labels:

`Line, Text, Length, Word, Foot, Half-line`

The data can actually include as many as 10 comma-delimited columns, however. Here is an example:

`37,"τοξ’,",long,3,3,hemi1,Chryses,newpara,speech,Chryses`
